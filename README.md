# homework-4
The goal of this homework project was to create a quiz with a timer.  The quiz should have multiple questions on JavaScript basics and these questions need to be answered in 60 seconds or less. 

The purpose of creating this JavaScript quiz was to pull together multiple concepts learned in the recent JS modules.  

This quiz is an html file with JavaScript link and a CSS stylesheet.
